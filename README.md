# CDistroDownloader
CDistroDownloader is a simple program that is extremely useful for users who often switch between different Linux distributions.
I give credit to Aaron-JM for creating the original Python version, This new version is written in C.

The number of distros included was reduced to 5 GNU/Linux distros from the original's 15. I chose distros with complete installs and a good amount of support.
